# vim-golang-alternate

Overrides vim's :A command to toggle between go implementation code and test code.

## usage

* `:A` will open the current file's tests or the current test's implementation based on what is currently opened.
* `:AS` will act the same as `:A` but will move the current file to a new buffer in a split.
* `:AV` will act the same as `:AS` but with a vertical split.
